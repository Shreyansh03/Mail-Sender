# Customized Mail-Sender from google sheets

This is a Google Apps Script code that takes the email address and particular info from the sheet and sends a customised email from your mail id. This is something that I created after getting tired of sending so many individual emails. You can use it to send scores of students, time slots for interviews to people, and a lot more such messages easily with just a click of a button.
